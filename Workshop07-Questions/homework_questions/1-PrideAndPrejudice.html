<p>
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
</p>
<p>
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well
fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their
daughters.
</p>
<p>
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
</p>
<p>
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
</p>
<p>
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
</p>
<p>
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
</p>
<p>
"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
</p>
<p>
This was invitation enough.
</p>
<p>
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of
England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed
with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house
by the end of next week."
</p>
<p>
"What is his name?"
</p>
<p>
"Bingley."
</p>
<p>
"Is he married or single?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our
girls!"
</p>
<p>
    "How so? How can it affect them?"
</p>
<p>
    "My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one
    of them."
