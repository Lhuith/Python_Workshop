#-----Assignment Description-----------------------------------------#
#
#  The Best, Then and Now
#
#  In this assignment you will combine your knowledge of HTMl/XML
#  mark-up languages with your skills in Python scripting, pattern
#  matching, and Graphical User Interface design to produce a useful
#  application that allows the user to preview and print lists of
#  top-ten rankings.  See the instruction sheet accompanying this
#  file for full details.

#-----Imported Functions---------------------------------------------#
#
# Below are various import statements for helpful functions.  You
# should be able to complete this assignment using these
# functions only.  Note that not all of these functions are
# needed to successfully complete this assignment.  YOU MAY NOT USE
# ANY NON-STANDARD MODULES SUCH AS 'Beautiful Soup' OR 'Pillow'.  ONLY
# MODULES THAT COME WITH A STANDARD PYTHON 3 INSTALLATION MAY BE
# USED.

# The function for opening a web document given its URL.
# (You WILL need to use this function in your solution,
# either directly or via our "download" function.)
from urllib.request import urlopen

# Import the standard Tkinter functions. (You WILL need to use
# these functions in your solution.)
from tkinter import *

# Functions for finding all occurrences of a pattern
# defined via a regular expression, as well as
# the "multiline" and "dotall" flags.  (You do NOT need to
# use these functions in your solution, because the problem
# can be solved with the string "find" function, but it will
# be difficult to produce a concise and robust solution
# without using regular expressions.)
from re import findall, finditer, MULTILINE, DOTALL

# Import the standard SQLite functions (just in case they're
# needed).
from sqlite3 import *

#
#--------------------------------------------------------------------#



#-----Downloader Function--------------------------------------------#
#
# This is our function for downloading a web page's content and both
# saving it on a local file and returning its source code
# as a Unicode string. The function tries to produce a
# meaningful error message if the attempt fails.  WARNING: This
# function will silently overwrite the target file if it
# already exists!  NB: You should change the filename extension to
# "xhtml" when downloading an XML document.  (You do NOT need to use
# this function in your solution if you choose to call "urlopen"
# directly, but it is provided for your convenience.)
#
def download(url = 'http://www.wikipedia.org/',
             target_filename = 'download',
             filename_extension = 'html'):

    # Import an exception raised when a web server denies access
    # to a document
    from urllib.error import HTTPError

    # Open the web document for reading
    try:
        web_page = urlopen(url)
    except ValueError:
        raise Exception("Download error - Cannot find document at URL '" + url + "'")
    except HTTPError:
        raise Exception("Download error - Access denied to document at URL '" + url + "'")
    except:
        raise Exception("Download error - Something went wrong when trying to download " + \
                        "the document at URL '" + url + "'")

    # Read its contents as a Unicode string
    try:
        web_page_contents = web_page.read().decode('UTF-8')
    except UnicodeDecodeError:
        raise Exception("Download error - Unable to decode document at URL '" + \
                        url + "' as Unicode text")

    # Write the contents to a local text file as Unicode
    # characters (overwriting the file if it
    # already exists!)
    try:
        text_file = open(target_filename + '.' + filename_extension,
                         'w', encoding = 'UTF-8')
        text_file.write(web_page_contents)
        text_file.close()
    except:
        raise Exception("Download error - Unable to write to file '" + \
                        target_file + "'")

    # Return the downloaded document to the caller
    return web_page_contents
